PREPPING PRINTS FOR PAINTING:
- Put on mask (respirator)
- start with 120 sanding, wrap the sandpaper around a sponge. Then 220, then 320, then 400, then filling with bondo. Then sand with 400, then 600, then wash in soap and water, then wet sand 1200, wash with soap and water, dry, then paint.

Step by step:
- Sand with 120 grit sandpaper, wrapped around sponge, don’t forget cracks and crevices
- Sand with 220
- Sand with 320
- Sand with 400
- Wash the print with soap and water
- Before using the 2 in 1 primer, let the bottle sit in a bath of warm water for awhile
- Apply, don’t get to close, should be 8-10 inches. Do a couple coats, I think it needs to be like 12-24 hours per coat
- Sand with 400 Sandpaper, don’t forget to sand in the cracks and stuff to make sure the details are visible
- Wash with soap and water
- For thicker layer lines that won’t be solved with the primer, this is where you use bondo. Apply with with a piece of foam. Probably don’t need to go nuts, just cover big cracks. Look for lines.
- Dont forget to do the underside (?) of the helmet
- Sand with 400 paper, make sure to do this outside. 
- After sanding, add another coat of the 2 in 1 sandable fillable primer. Do you wash the helmet first?
- Some of the details are getting gummed up, use a pick of file to scrape out the primer so the lines are distinct. 
- Wet sand. Wet the helmet or sandpaper, then use a 600 grit around the whole helmet. He applied some water to an area and then sanded, 
- Wet sand again with 1500
- Wash with soap and water and dry. 
- now ready to take paint.


# GALACTIC ARMORY
- sand the edges of the pieces of the helmet
- Then sodder
- 120 grit sandpaper first, hand sand lightly, get the rough/high spots, first pass (get 80-90% of the layer lines)
- Then add 2 in 1 (probably wash first right)
- Sand (120)
- Use bondo
- Sand (120)
- more filler primer (2 in 1)
- Sand (120)
- When happy with the smoothness of the helmet, sand with 300 or higher.
- Painting: flat black primer first (1 or 2 coats)
- tinted grinding shield or black window tint
Another thing to do:
- last coat before painting: plastic-dip. Gives it a nice texture and feeling. 1 or 2 coats, don’t go on too heavy in any area (I triple checked, he indeed put this on BEFORE paint). 30 min between coats
