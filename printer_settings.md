## Frankly Built

CURA SETTINGS:
- 5-10% infill with gyroid infill
- Speed: 50-70% on the Ender (bigger prints should probably go slower, not sure about the SR)
- Travel: extraction and z-hop on (I think he had this off later)
- Support: everywhere
- Overhand angle: around 65 or 70, The higher the less safe it is
- For tall prints, use “Rafts”, 10-15 raft margin (if raft comes up, drop top layer down for a thinner raft)
- Normal supports or Tree supports (remember to turn the one you aren’t using OFF)
- Taller/straight builds don’t need as much support?
- Red=where supports are needed
- When you drop in a model
- Profiles=print quality
-  After hitting slice=make sure to go to preview to look at the model
- in preview, change to “line type” which will show you the lines
- quality=layer height
- 5-10% infill is what Frank uses on all his suits etc
- infill is a big one: gyroid infill, 5-10%
- temperature: might be worth doing a temperature tower when getting new types of filament
- print speed: too low is bad, too fast is bad. 100m/s is fast for an ender, bad for tall things. Maybe 60-80%
- enable retratiction
- Frank no longer uses z-hop
- support material=support density should be 
- support overhand angle: maybe 60?
- 2-3% support density
- build plate adhesion=raft, or least a skirt or whatever
- 1 and 5-10 for raft settings
